DotFiles
========

Manages all my config files. 

Fetch DotFiles to your home directory. 
Then run the `setup.sh` to link things into the right place. 

Installs the `.bashrc`, `.inputrc`, `.bash_logout`, and `.profile`.

Assuming if you do not have (liquidprompt)[https://github.com/nojhan/liquidprompt] installed, it will be cloned from github and set up for you. 

If you have zsh installed, (oh-my-zsh)[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh] will be automatically installed and set up using the agnoster theme. 

Also I used to be / still am a pretty big emacs geek. So (prelude)[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude] will be auto installed for you. And my custom settings will be symlinked into the right place. 

Finally it will symlink in your .vimrc since I am trying to learn vim.
